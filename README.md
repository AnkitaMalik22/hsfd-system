# Hotel Surplus Food Distribution System
The Hotel Surplus Food Distribution System is a platform that bridges the gap between hotels with surplus food and volunteers willing to distribute it to those in need. 

This system streamlines the process, making it easy for hotels and volunteers to collaborate effectively.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Registration & Login**

Hotels and volunteers can register and log in to the platform.

**Step 2: Hotel Adds The Surplus Food**

Hotels with surplus food can list the available items on the platform, ensuring no food goes to waste.

Volunteers can browse and request available surplus food items from hotels in their vicinity.

**Step 4: Hotel Accepts The Request**

Hotels review requests and accept them, making the surplus food available for pickup.


**Step 5: Volunteer Picks Up The Food**

Volunteers coordinate with the hotel to pick up the surplus food and distribute it to those in need.
